## Notes

1. The segmented control was not working properly in the beginning. I had to remove it and add it back again to get that working.
2. Saving and reading the default values were easy, but powerful
3. Sample code provided in the viedo and web pages are obselete and I had reseach to find correct code
4. Overall, it was really fun doing this excercise
